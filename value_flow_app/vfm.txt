Step 1: Update Basic Information

Change the process title:

"Sage and onion stuffing" → "SimplePharma Inventory Management"
Mark "Current" in the state indicators (Current/Future/Ideal)


Update the date to the current date (April 2025)

Step 2: Replace Suppliers

Replace supplier information:

"PURE" → "MedDev" (with "2 TIMES/WEEK" delivery frequency)
"TMC" → "DrugSeek" (with "3 TIMES/WEEK" delivery frequency)
"EVRON" → "VitaFast" (with "2 TIMES/WEEK" delivery frequency)


Update supplier delivery notes:

"Delivery to stock" → "Delivery to inward goods zone"
"monthly forecast purchasing weekly delivery Daily" → "Orders based on previous year sales, online orders, and periodic events"



Step 3: Update Customer Information

Replace customer details:

"Bally mun Depot" → "SimplePharma Customers"
"Sage & onion 1000 x 400g daily" → "Medical devices and drugs"
"10 x 454g/case" → "Various packaging"
"100 cases" → "Daily average sales"



Step 4: Replace Process Steps

Replace process boxes with SimplePharma's processes:

"Receiving" → Keep "Receiving" (inward goods arrival)
"WEIGH UP" → "Check Dockets" (verification of delivery)
"COOKING" → "Main Warehouse" (storing medical devices)
"BLAST CHILLING" → "Transfer to Shop" (moving products to shop)
"MIXING" → "Store in Shop" (placing on shelves)
"TUBBING" → "Sell to Customer" (sales process)
"Weigh chk" → "Stock Control" (monitoring inventory)
"packing" → "Manual Count" (stock-take counting)
"freezing/temper" → "Scanning" (barcode scanning during stock-take)
"Dispatch" → Keep "Dispatch" (products leaving pharmacy)



Step 5: Update Process Data

Fill in process data based on available information:
a. For "Receiving":

C/T: 30 mins (estimated time to receive goods)
C/O: 15 mins (estimated time to prepare for next delivery)
FPY: 100% (assuming all receipts are processed correctly)

b. For "Check Dockets":

C/T: 20 mins (time to verify delivery against documents)
C/O: 10 mins
FPY: 100%

c. For "Main Warehouse":

C/T: 45 mins (time to store goods in warehouse)
C/O: 15 mins
FPY: 100%

d. For "Transfer to Shop":

C/T: 25 mins (based on document stating time to transfer)

Sell to Customer: 2 people
Stock Control: 1 person
Manual Count: 6 people (all staff involved in stock-take)
Scanning: 6 people (using 6 scanners mentioned in document)
Dispatch: 1 person



Step 7: Update Information Flow

Update the information flow arrows:

Keep "Production Control" in the center
Connect to "PLANNING" and "PURCHASING"
Add "ERP Omega" system information flow connecting all processes
Add "Daily Orders" and "Monthly Forecast" from shop to production control
Show information flow for stock requests from shop to warehouse



Step 8: Add Notes on Non-Value Activities

Add notes about non-value activities:

"90 mins for washdown, 30mins set up" → "Staff search time for zones: 5 mins per group"
"non added value aprox 80 mins" → "Manual counting and scanner upload time: 5 mins per scanner"
"Quality checks = 200 mins lost per cycle" → "Recounting due to inconsistencies: 60-90 mins per stock-take"
"non added value recording and checks 1 person full-time" → "Data verification and corrections: 1-2 hours per stock-take"



Step 9: Highlight Problem Areas

Mark the key problem areas with triangles:

Manual Count process (inefficient manual counting with sticky notes)
Scanning process (delays in scanning and data upload)
Information flow between warehouse and shop
Stock-take scheduling (quarterly closures)



Step 10: Add Lean Opportunities

Indicate potential Lean improvements:

Add a Kanban symbol near the inventory management processes
Add a 5S symbol near the storage areas
Add SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Die) opportunities for reducing setup times
Indicate opportunities for automation (RFID implementation)



Step 11: Calculate Key Process Metrics

Calculate and add overall process metrics:

Total Lead Time: Sum of all process times
Value-Added Time: Sum of value-adding process times
Process Cycle Efficiency: Value-Added Time / Total Lead Time
Current accuracy rate: 76.5% (from baseline data)

Regular Operations (Non-Stock-Take Processes)

Receiving (Inward goods arrival):

OEE/Util: 92%
Rationale: High accuracy in receipt process, but occasional delays when multiple deliveries arrive simultaneously.


Check Dockets (Verification of delivery):

OEE/Util: 95%
Rationale: Documentation process is mostly standardized with minimal errors.


Main Warehouse (Storing medical devices):

OEE/Util: 88%
Rationale: Based on warehouse accuracy rate of 70.89% from categorical analysis, with adjustments for general operations being more efficient than stock-taking.


Transfer to Shop (Moving products to shop):

OEE/Util: 85%
Rationale: Some inefficiency due to movement between buildings and manual transfer processes.


Store in Shop (Placing on shelves):

OEE/Util: 82%
Rationale: Shop floor operations show 78.81% accuracy during counts, adjusted for regular operations.


Sell to Customer (Sales process):

OEE/Util: 93%
Rationale: Customer-facing process is well-maintained with high performance standards.


Stock Control (Monitoring inventory):

OEE/Util: 80%
Rationale: Regular checks show moderate efficiency but lack real-time visibility.



Stock-Taking Processes

Manual Count (Stock-take counting):

OEE/Util: 62%
Rationale: Directly based on Manual Count accuracy of 62.19% from categorical analysis, reflecting inefficiencies in the current process.


Scanning (Barcode scanning during stock-take):

OEE/Util: 75%
Rationale: Scanner Count accuracy is 85.10%, but reduced by data upload delays and waiting time between zones.


Data Verification (Team leader checking):

OEE/Util: 68%
Rationale: Process involves duplication of effort and frequent inconsistencies requiring recounts.


Dispatch (Products leaving pharmacy):

OEE/Util: 90%
Rationale: Outbound logistics are generally efficient with few errors.



Overall System Efficiency
The overall system OEE would be approximately 78% for regular operations, dropping to around 65% during stock-taking periods, which aligns with our observed baseline accuracy of 76.50% and accounts for the significant efficiency drops during quarterly stock-takes.
These estimates highlight critical improvement opportunities, particularly in the manual count and scanning processes, where implementing RFID technology as proposed in the project charter could dramatically increase efficiency and eliminate the need for disruptive quarterly stock-takes.
