USER ACCEPTANCE TEST PLAN
Lean Six Sigma Site Implementation
Date: April 25, 2025

1. INTRODUCTION
===============
This User Acceptance Test (UAT) Plan outlines the testing strategy for the Lean Six Sigma project site implementation. It defines the test cases, acceptance criteria, and procedures to verify that the site structure meets the requirements specified in the implementation plan.

2. TEST OBJECTIVES
=================
- Verify that all DMAIC phase pages contain the required artifacts as specified in the implementation plan
- Ensure consistent structure across all phase pages
- Validate cross-phase navigation and linking
- Confirm that all interactive elements function correctly
- Verify responsive design across different device sizes

3. TEST ENVIRONMENT
==================
- Desktop browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge (latest versions)
- Mobile browsers: iOS Safari, Android Chrome
- Screen sizes: Desktop (1920x1080), Tablet (768x1024), Mobile (375x667)

TC-10: Interactive Elements
- Test all interactive elements in each phase
- Verify tooltips and hover effects
- Check form controls if present

4.3 RESPONSIVENESS TESTING
--------------------------
TC-11: Desktop Responsiveness
- Test layout at 1920x1080, 1366x768, and 1024x768
- Verify all content is properly displayed
- Check navigation menu behavior

TC-12: Tablet Responsiveness
- Test layout at 768x1024 (portrait) and 1024x768 (landscape)
- Verify content adapts to screen size
- Check touch-friendly controls

TC-13: Mobile Responsiveness
- Test layout at 375x667 (iPhone) and 360x740 (Android)

5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
=====================
- All specified artifacts are present and accessible in each phase
- Navigation between phases and to related artifacts works seamlessly
- Interactive elements function correctly on all platforms
- Content is legible and usable on all tested device sizes
- No broken links or missing images
- Page load time is under 3 seconds for all main phase pages

6. DEFECT MANAGEMENT
===================
Defects will be categorized as follows:
- Critical: Prevents a phase page from being viewed or used
- High: Major functionality or artifact is not working
- Medium: Function works but with limitations or workarounds
- Low: Minor visual or non-critical functionality issues

7. TEST EXECUTION
================
Testing will be conducted by:
- Project Leader: Jennifer Wu
- IT Systems Analyst: Lisa Chen
- Quality Assurance Specialist: Robert Garcia

Testing period: April 26-28, 2025

8. SIGN-OFF CRITERIA
===================
UAT will be considered successful when:
- All critical and high-priority defects are resolved
- At least 90% of test cases pass
- All DMAIC phase pages contain their required artifacts
- Site functions correctly across all specified browsers and devices
