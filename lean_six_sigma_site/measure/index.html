                <h3>Phase Overview</h3>
                <p>The Measure phase focuses on gathering baseline data about the current process performance. During this phase, we validated our measurement system, collected data on inventory discrepancies, and established a performance baseline to measure future improvements against.</p>

                <p>Before collecting data for process improvement, we needed to validate that our measurement system itself was capable of producing reliable and consistent results.

                    <h4>What is Measurement System Analysis?</h4>
                    <p>Measurement System Analysis (MSA) is a structured method to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of a measurement system. It helps determine how much of the observed process variation is due to the measurement system itself versus actual process variation. A reliable measurement system should:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be accurate (provide measurements close to the true value)</li>
                        <li>Be precise (provide consistent results when measuring the same item multiple times)</li>
                        <li>Have stability over time (provide the same results when measuring the same item at different times)</li>
                        <li>Show reproducibility (provide consistent results when different operators measure the same item)</li>
                    </ul>

                        </ul>
                        <li>Had 3 different appraisers (Pharmacy Staff, Warehouse Team, and Team Leader) evaluate each item twice</li>
                        <li>Compared their assessments against known standard values</li>

                    <h4>MSA Key Findings</h4>
                    <p>Our MSA revealed several important insights about our measurement system:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Team Leader showed the highest accuracy (95.2% agreement with standard), followed by Warehouse Team (91.8%) and Pharmacy Staff (89.5%)</li>
                        <li>Medical devices had the lowest agreement rates (88.7%), likely due to their complexity</li>
                        <li>The measurement system passed all acceptance criteria, indicating it is sufficiently reliable for data collection</li>
                        <li>Slight differences in appraisal methods were observed, suggesting the need for additional standardization in counting procedures</li>

                <h3>Sample Size Determination</h3>

                    <h4>Sample Size Calculation Approach</h4>

                    <ul>

## Identified Issues and Root Causes

Analysis of the inventory data reveals several critical issues affecting the stocktake process:

1. **Staff Training Deficiencies:** Staff with basic training have significantly lower accuracy rates (65.3%) compared to those with advanced training (87.3%), indicating a clear relationship between training level and count accuracy (p < 0.001).

2. **Counting Method Inefficiencies:** Manual counting shows substantially lower accuracy (62.2%) compared to scanner-based counting (85.1%), representing a 22.9 percentage point gap in performance (p < 0.001).

3. **Time-of-Day Impact:** Morning counts are more accurate than evening counts, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.027), suggesting fatigue or time pressure affects accuracy.

4. **Staff Experience Gap:** Staff with more experience (average of 5.6 years) demonstrate higher accuracy compared to less experienced staff (average of 4.2 years), highlighting the importance of experience in inventory counting (p < 0.001).

## Process Bottlenecks

The stocktake process contains several bottlenecks that limit efficiency and accuracy:

1. **Scanner Availability Constraints:** Only six scanners are distributed among staff groups, limiting the use of the more accurate scanning method and forcing some groups to use less accurate manual counting.

2. **Data Upload Delays:** The process of having the sales manager upload data to the Omega ERP system creates a bottleneck, with staff waiting for this step to complete before proceeding.

3. **Verification and Recount Cycles:** When discrepancies are found, items must be recounted, creating additional bottlenecks and extending the total process time beyond the target takt time of 6 hours.

4. **Staff Allocation Issues:** Suboptimal distribution of skilled staff across counting zones leads to inefficient resource utilization, with team leaders (who demonstrate higher accuracy) not always assigned to the most critical counting areas.

## Waste Analysis (Lean Perspective)

The inventory process contains multiple forms of waste as defined by Lean principles:

### Motion Waste
- Unnecessary movement during counting process
- Placing sticky notes with counted quantities on shelves
- Movement between manual counting and scanning phases

### Waiting Waste
- Staff lunch break (1 hour)
- Waiting for data upload to Omega ERP (variable time)
- Waiting for scanner distribution and return

### Transportation Waste
- Moving between building areas (shop floor, storage, warehouse)
- Returning scanners to sales manager

### Defects Waste
- 23.5% overall error rate in counting
- 10.19% average magnitude of errors when they occur
- Recounting required for discrepancies

### Overprocessing Waste
- Double counting (manual and scanner)
- Placing sticky notes as a temporary record
- Multiple data entry points (paper to scanner to ERP)

### Inventory Waste
- Inaccurate counts leading to potential stockouts or excess inventory
- Extended process duration (7 hours vs. target 6 hours)

### Talent Waste
- Misalignment of staff skills and counting responsibilities
- Underutilization of advanced-trained staff

## Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ)

The current inventory process generates significant costs due to quality issues:

- **Revenue Loss:** €3,600 per stocktake due to closure during counting
- **Staff Overtime:** €720 per stocktake
- **Inventory Inaccuracy Cost:** €4,200 per quarter
- **Total Annual COPQ:** €34,080

## Improvement Opportunities

Data analysis suggests several opportunities for process improvement:

1. **Standardize on Scanner-Based Counting:** Given the 22.9 percentage point accuracy advantage, increasing scanner availability and standardizing on scanner counting could significantly improve accuracy.

2. **Training Program Enhancement:** The 21.8 percentage point gap between basic and advanced training indicates substantial ROI potential for enhanced training programs.

3. **Morning Scheduling:** Rescheduling stocktakes to morning hours could improve accuracy based on the statistically significant time-of-day effect.

4. **Process Redesign:** Eliminating non-value-added activities like sticky notes and multiple data entry points could reduce the current 50% non-value-added time.

5. **RFID Implementation:** As outlined in the project charter, RFID technology implementation could eliminate manual counting entirely, achieving the target 99% accuracy rate.
