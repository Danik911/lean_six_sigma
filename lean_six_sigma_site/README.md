## üìã Project Overview

This Lean Six Sigma project focuses on improving inventory accuracy processes at SimplePharma, a pharmaceutical distribution company facing challenges with inventory discrepancies. The company has been experiencing inconsistencies between system records and physical counts, leading to supply chain disruptions, customer dissatisfaction, and regulatory compliance concerns.

The project follows the DMAIC methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) to systematically identify root causes of inventory discrepancies and implement sustainable solutions. This web-based documentation site provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the entire improvement process, complete with interactive tools, data visualizations, and detailed reports.

## üîç DMAIC Methodology Explained

This project is structured around the five phases of the DMAIC methodology:

### 1. Define

The Define phase establishes the scope, goals, and deliverables of the project. Key elements include:

- Project charter outlining objectives and business case
- SIPOC diagram mapping the process context
- Value Stream Map visualization
- Process Flow Diagram showing detailed workflow
- Stakeholder analysis and Voice of the Customer capture

### 2. Measure

The Measure phase focuses on gathering baseline data about current process performance:

- Measurement System Analysis (MSA) to validate data collection methods
- Data Collection Plan documenting what, how, when, and who
- Sample size determination using statistical methods
- Baseline performance metrics (76.50% accuracy, well below the target of 99%)
- Process capability analysis and sigma level calculation (2.4 sigma)

### 3. Analyze

The Analyze phase examines data to identify root causes of inventory discrepancies:

- Statistical analysis of key factors (training level, count method, location)
- Root cause analysis using tools like fishbone diagrams
- Hypothesis testing to validate suspected causes
- Data visualization to identify patterns and trends
- Detailed analysis reports with statistical findings

Our analysis revealed that discrepancies cluster around specific:
- Product types (high-value items)
- Locations (cold storage areas with 26.5% discrepancy rate)
- Times (end-of-month periods)
- Staff roles (temporary staff)

The data also showed concerning patterns:
- 18.2% overall discrepancy rate
- 23% variance in high-value pharmaceuticals
- Significant financial impact

### 4. Improve

The Improve phase develops and implements solutions to address root causes:

- Value Stream Mapping to identify waste and opportunities
- Solution Selection Matrix to evaluate potential improvements
- RFID Implementation Design for automated tracking
- 5S Implementation for workplace organization
- Standardized Training Program development
- Cycle Counting Redesign for more frequent, smaller counts

### 5. Control

The Control phase ensures that improvements are sustained over time:

- Statistical Process Control (SPC) with control charts
- Comprehensive Control Plan documenting monitoring procedures
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for consistent execution
- Competency Management through ongoing training
- Audit program for regular verification of adherence

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into directories representing each phase of the DMAIC methodology:
