Current accuracy rate: 76.5% (from baseline data)

Regular Operations (Non-Stock-Take Processes)

Receiving (Inward goods arrival):

OEE/Util: 92%
Rationale: High accuracy in receipt process, but occasional delays when multiple deliveries arrive simultaneously.


Check Dockets (Verification of delivery):

OEE/Util: 95%
Rationale: Documentation process is mostly standardized with minimal errors.


Main Warehouse (Storing medical devices):

OEE/Util: 88%
Rationale: Based on warehouse accuracy rate of 70.89% from categorical analysis, with adjustments for general operations being more efficient than stock-taking.


Transfer to Shop (Moving products to shop):

OEE/Util: 85%
Rationale: Some inefficiency due to movement between buildings and manual transfer processes.


Store in Shop (Placing on shelves):

OEE/Util: 82%
Rationale: Shop floor operations show 78.81% accuracy during counts, adjusted for regular operations.


Sell to Customer (Sales process):

OEE/Util: 93%
Rationale: Customer-facing process is well-maintained with high performance standards.


Stock Control (Monitoring inventory):

OEE/Util: 80%
Rationale: Regular checks show moderate efficiency but lack real-time visibility.



Stock-Taking Processes

Manual Count (Stock-take counting):

OEE/Util: 62%
Rationale: Directly based on Manual Count accuracy of 62.19% from categorical analysis, reflecting inefficiencies in the current process.


Scanning (Barcode scanning during stock-take):

OEE/Util: 75%
Rationale: Scanner Count accuracy is 85.10%, but reduced by data upload delays and waiting time between zones.


Data Verification (Team leader checking):

OEE/Util: 68%
Rationale: Process involves duplication of effort and frequent inconsistencies requiring recounts.


Dispatch (Products leaving pharmacy):

OEE/Util: 90%
Rationale: Outbound logistics are generally efficient with few errors.



Overall System Efficiency
The overall system OEE would be approximately 78% for regular operations, dropping to around 65% during stock-taking periods, which aligns with our observed baseline accuracy of 76.50% and accounts for the significant efficiency drops during quarterly stock-takes.
These estimates highlight critical improvement opportunities, particularly in the manual count and scanning processes, where implementing RFID technology as proposed in the project charter could dramatically increase efficiency and eliminate the need for disruptive quarterly stock-takes.
