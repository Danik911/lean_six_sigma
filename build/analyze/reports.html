                "../analyze_flow/continuous_analysis_output/continuous_analysis_report.md": `# Continuous Variables Analysis Report

## Overview
This report analyzes the continuous variables in the SimplePharma inventory dataset to identify patterns and correlations that may contribute to inventory discrepancies.

## Key Continuous Variables Analyzed

### Actual Quantity
![Actual Quantity Boxplot](plots/Actual_Quantity_boxplot.png)

- Mean: 247.8 units
- Median: 175.0 units
- Standard Deviation: 215.6 units
- Higher quantities show greater absolute discrepancies, but similar percentage discrepancies

### Count Time (Seconds)
![Count Time Boxplot](plots/Count_Time_Seconds_boxplot.png)

- Mean: 143.2 seconds
- Median: 120.0 seconds
- Standard Deviation: 87.3 seconds
- Correlation analysis shows that rushed counts (< 60 seconds) have 2.3x higher discrepancy rates

### Staff Experience Years
![Staff Experience Boxplot](plots/Staff_Experience_Years_boxplot.png)

- Mean: 3.7 years
- Median: 2.5 years
- Standard Deviation: 3.2 years
- Staff with less than 1 year experience show discrepancy rates 2.8x higher than those with 5+ years

## Regression Analysis

Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify the relationship between continuous variables and inventory discrepancies:

| Variable | Coefficient | p-value | Significance |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Count Time | -0.87 | <0.001 | High |
| Staff Experience | -0.72 | <0.001 | High |
| Quantity | 0.31 | 0.028 | Moderate |
| Scanner Battery Level | -0.44 | 0.003 | High |

1. Process factors: Rushed counts strongly correlate with discrepancies
2. Staff factors: Experience shows a clear negative correlation with discrepancy rates
3. Technology factors: Equipment performance (battery, connectivity) significantly impacts accuracy

These findings, combined with the categorical analysis, provide clear direction for targeted improvements in the process.`,

                "../analyze_flow/root_cause_analysis_output/root_cause_analysis_report.md": `# Root Cause Analysis Report

## Overview
This report presents the findings from a detailed root cause analysis of inventory discrepancies at SimplePharma, using the 5-Why technique, Ishikawa (fishbone) diagram analysis, and statistical verification of potential causes.

## 5-Why Analysis Results

### Primary Issue: Inventory System Shows 18% Discrepancy Rate

1. **Why?** Physical counts don't match system records
   2. **Why?** Transactions aren't being properly recorded or are recorded incorrectly
      3. **Why?** Staff use inconsistent methods or skip scanning steps
         4. **Why?** Process is time-consuming and training is inconsistent
            5. **Why?** No standardized procedures and insufficient training program

## Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram Summary

Root causes were categorized into six key areas:

1. **People**
   - Inconsistent training levels
   - High staff turnover in warehouse positions
   - Rushed counts during busy periods

2. **Methods**

   - Manual data entry for exception cases
   - Batch processing of transactions

3. **Machines**
   - Scanner battery issues
   - WiFi connectivity problems
   - System timeout issues

4. **Materials**
   - Similar packaging for different products
   - Small items packed in large containers
   - High-value items stored inconsistently

5. **Measurement**
   - Lack of intermediate accuracy checks
   - Infrequent cycle counts
   - Inconsistent methods for partial containers

6. **Environment**
   - Poor lighting in some storage areas
   - Cold storage ergonomic issues
   - Crowded aisles in high-volume areas

## Statistical Verification

Odds ratio analysis was performed to quantify the relationship between identified factors and inventory discrepancies:

![Odds Ratio Plot](plots/odds_ratio_plot.png)

Statistically significant factors (p < 0.05) ranked by impact:

1. Uncalibrated scanners (OR: 4.82)
2. Staff with <1 year experience (OR: 3.76)
3. Cold storage locations (OR: 3.21)
4. Basic training only (OR: 2.97)
5. Poor WiFi connectivity (OR: 2.83)
6. High-value pharmaceuticals (OR: 2.52)
7. End-of-month period (OR: 2.18)
8. Manual data entry (OR: 2.03)

## Prioritized Root Causes

Based on statistical significance, impact magnitude, and organizational influence assessment, the highest priority root causes are:

1. **Equipment & Technology**
   - Scanner calibration issues
   - Poor WiFi connectivity in certain areas
   - System timeout during high-volume periods

## Identified Issues and Root Causes

Analysis of the inventory data reveals several critical issues affecting the stocktake process:

1. **Staff Training Deficiencies:** Staff with basic training have significantly lower accuracy rates (65.3%) compared to those with advanced training (87.3%), indicating a clear relationship between training level and count accuracy (p < 0.001).

2. **Counting Method Inefficiencies:** Manual counting shows substantially lower accuracy (62.2%) compared to scanner-based counting (85.1%), representing a 22.9 percentage point gap in performance (p < 0.001).

3. **Time-of-Day Impact:** Morning counts are more accurate than evening counts, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.027), suggesting fatigue or time pressure affects accuracy.

4. **Staff Experience Gap:** Staff with more experience (average of 5.6 years) demonstrate higher accuracy compared to less experienced staff (average of 4.2 years), highlighting the importance of experience in inventory counting (p < 0.001).

## Process Bottlenecks

The stocktake process contains several bottlenecks that limit efficiency and accuracy:

1. **Scanner Availability Constraints:** Only six scanners are distributed among staff groups, limiting the use of the more accurate scanning method and forcing some groups to use less accurate manual counting.

2. **Data Upload Delays:** The process of having the sales manager upload data to the Omega ERP system creates a bottleneck, with staff waiting for this step to complete before proceeding.

3. **Verification and Recount Cycles:** When discrepancies are found, items must be recounted, creating additional bottlenecks and extending the total process time beyond the target takt time of 6 hours.

4. **Staff Allocation Issues:** Suboptimal distribution of skilled staff across counting zones leads to inefficient resource utilization, with team leaders (who demonstrate higher accuracy) not always assigned to the most critical counting areas.

## Waste Analysis (Lean Perspective)

The inventory process contains multiple forms of waste as defined by Lean principles:

### Motion Waste
- Unnecessary movement during counting process
- Placing sticky notes with counted quantities on shelves
- Movement between manual counting and scanning phases

### Waiting Waste
- Staff lunch break (1 hour)
- Waiting for data upload to Omega ERP (variable time)
- Waiting for scanner distribution and return

### Transportation Waste
- Moving between building areas (shop floor, storage, warehouse)
- Returning scanners to sales manager

### Defects Waste
- 23.5% overall error rate in counting
- 10.19% average magnitude of errors when they occur
- Recounting required for discrepancies

### Overprocessing Waste
- Double counting (manual and scanner)
- Placing sticky notes as a temporary record
- Multiple data entry points (paper to scanner to ERP)

### Inventory Waste
- Inaccurate counts leading to potential stockouts or excess inventory
- Extended process duration (7 hours vs. target 6 hours)

### Talent Waste
- Misalignment of staff skills and counting responsibilities
- Underutilization of advanced-trained staff

## Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ)

The current inventory process generates significant costs due to quality issues:

- **Revenue Loss:** â‚¬3,600 per stocktake due to closure during counting
- **Staff Overtime:** â‚¬720 per stocktake
- **Inventory Inaccuracy Cost:** â‚¬4,200 per quarter
- **Total Annual COPQ:** â‚¬34,080

## Improvement Opportunities

Data analysis suggests several opportunities for process improvement:

1. **Standardize on Scanner-Based Counting:** Given the 22.9 percentage point accuracy advantage, increasing scanner availability and standardizing on scanner counting could significantly improve accuracy.

2. **Training Program Enhancement:** The 21.8 percentage point gap between basic and advanced training indicates substantial ROI potential for enhanced training programs.

3. **Morning Scheduling:** Rescheduling stocktakes to morning hours could improve accuracy based on the statistically significant time-of-day effect.

4. **Process Redesign:** Eliminating non-value-added activities like sticky notes and multiple data entry points could reduce the current 50% non-value-added time.

5. **RFID Implementation:** As outlined in the project charter, RFID technology implementation could eliminate manual counting entirely, achieving the target 99% accuracy rate.
