Operations & Lean Six Sigma Implementation Plan
April 15th   

Document Status: Draft | In Review | Approved 
________________________________________

Executive Summary:
To establish a sustainable and efficient pharmaceutical retail operation by implementing digital transformation technologies and Lean Six Sigma principles that eliminate wasteful processes, improve inventory accuracy, and enhance customer value delivery.
Project Goal
SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound
●	Transform SimplePharma's inventory management and stock-taking processes by implementing RFID technology and AI-powered systems, eliminating quarterly stock-take closures, reducing inventory discrepancies by 95%, and increasing revenue by 15% within 18 months of implementation.


Deliverables
1.	Implement an RFID-based inventory tracking system with AWS cloud infrastructure to achieve continuous inventory visibility and eliminate quarterly stock-take closures within 12 months.
2.	Deploy AI-powered demand forecasting and smart replenishment systems to reduce stockouts by 95% and excess inventory by 30% within 15 months.
3.	Develop and implement digital process flows that eliminate manual, paper-based tasks and reduce staff time spent on inventory management by 80% within 18 months.
4.	Establish a control and monitoring system with real-time dashboards to maintain inventory accuracy above 99% and ensure continuous improvement.


Business Case / Background	
Why are we doing this?
●	SimplePharma currently operates with inefficient, manual processes for inventory management, particularly the quarterly stock-take process that requires store closure, manual counting, sticky notes, and frequent recounting due to inconsistencies.
●	The current process results in revenue loss during the 6-hour closure period (3 p.m. to 9 p.m.), inefficient use of staff time, inventory inaccuracies leading to stockouts and excess inventory, and poor customer experience.
●	Digital transformation through RFID technology, cloud infrastructure, and AI solutions will eliminate these inefficiencies, drastically improve inventory accuracy, optimize staff utilization, and enhance the overall value stream.


Benefits, Costs, and Budget
Benefits:
●	Elimination of revenue loss during quarterly stock-takes (estimated at 24 hours of sales annually)
●	95% reduction in inventory discrepancies, leading to fewer stockouts and lost sales
●	80% reduction in staff time spent on inventory tasks, allowing reallocation to customer service
●	Improved demand forecasting accuracy leading to optimized inventory levels
●	Enhanced customer experience through better product availability (99.5% target)
Additional benefits: 
●	Real-time visibility across all inventory locations
●	Automated replenishment triggering based on actual demand
●	Predictive analytics for seasonal demand fluctuations
●	Reduced waste in movement, waiting, and overprocessing
●	Enhanced compliance and audit capabilities
Costs:
●	RFID infrastructure (tags, readers, edge computing)
●	AWS cloud architecture implementation and subscription
●	AI/ML model development and implementation
●	Staff training on new systems and processes
●	Project management and implementation services
Additional cost areas (optional):
●	System integration with existing ERP (Omega)
●	Change management activities
●	Hardware upgrades where needed
●	Potential short-term productivity dip during transition
Budget needed:
●	 €150,000
