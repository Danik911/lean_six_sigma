Assignment description.
I will create an assignment in form of a Lean Six Sigma DMAIC project. 
I took a real process from my work and change the name of the company and suppliers. 
I will create value stream map and process stream map at first and then will add as many elements as possible depending on time that I have.
The project will be in a PDF format with multiple pages. Charts and diagrams will be in picture format with links for the original charts/diagrams. I want to upload related materials into GitHub of a cloud with open access.

A pharmacy named SimplePharma is selling medical devices and drugs.
The pharmacy infostructure includes 2 buildings.
1.	The main – shop building
At the ground floor is located warehouse for drugs and miscellaneous goods.
At the first floor is located the shop. 
In the shop there are 2 storage rooms. One for medical devices, one for other products (drugs and miscellaneous). 
The shop personnel responsible for selling the goods, filling the shelves and ordering products from the warehouse.
While ordering they send a list of necessary goods to the warehouse team.
2.	The main warehouse building.
Medical devices are stored in the main warehouse building at the 3rd floor.
The warehouse team check the medical device storage room at least twice a day to list devices that should be brought to the room. 
While checking they have a list of products with the necessary quantity.
They compare the quality in the list with the amount of goods.
After filling the list, the warehouse team goes to the main warehouse and pick up necessary devices. All these devices should be transferred via ERP system (Omega).
Then the warehouse team put all these devices in trolleys and deliver to the storage rooms in the shop building.
Also, the warehouse team receives lists of goods to be brought to the pharmacy floor from the drugs and miscellaneous warehouse. After picking the goods from the drugs warehouse the team brought it to the pharmacy floor and sales team is responsible to putting it on the shelves.
Also, the warehouse team at least twice a day inspect the storage room with drugs and miscellaneous and if needed list products that should be brought from the ground floor (the drug warehouse).
Also, there are 3 main suppliers: MedDev (medical device supplier),  DrugSeek(drugs supplier), and VitaFast ( miscellaneous goods).
The operation manager of the warehouse team is responsible for ordering goods.
He makes decisions based on previous year’s sales, online orders, and periodical events (flu epidemic etc..).
The suppliers receive the orders via ERP system(Omega). They check if the goods available if not order that from the manufacturer.
Then the suppliers deliver the stock. MedDev – working days, DrugSeek – 3 times a week, VitaFast – 2 times a week.
All trucks with delivery arrive to the inward goods zone between two buildings. If it is MedDev the warehouse team takes trolleys, put the goods on the trolleys and bring them to the main warehouse. If it is drugs or miscellaneous the team takes pallet truck and bring them to the drugs and miscellaneous warehouse in the shop building (ground floor). Then the warehouse team needs to count the stock and compare it with the quantity in the paper documents provided with the delivery. The quantity of goods is updated automatically in the Omega, because the suppliers and the pharmacy have the same database. When the warehouse team needs to bring medical devices to the shop they need to make a transaction in Omega (from the warehouse to the shop) but when they brought goods from drugs warehouse to the pharmacy shop they don’t need to do this because in the Omega it is shown an already in the shop.
Every 3 month the pharmacy performs stock take. During this procedure they partially close the pharmacy shop floor (medical device section) at 3 p.m. to count the products. Then they completely stop the trade at 5 p.m. Usually the shop works until 9 p.m. All personnel is involved in the stock take process. 
The stock take process includes:
-	Pharmacy shop and warehouse personnel arrives at 2 p.m. to the pharmacy floor.
-	The staff manually count all stock on the shelves and in 2 storage rooms. After counting the staff put a paper sticky note with written number (quantity of the products) on each shelf.
-	Then the personnel have a lunch at 5 p.m., it lasts for 1 hour.
-	Then the personnel come back and scan barcodes of all products. They use mobile scanners. The scanners send information to the Omega ESP.
-	Team leader of the warehouse check the received information via Excel. Usually there are a lot of inconsistencies and duplicates. 
-	As a result, team leader sends the staff to recount the products again and then update the data.
The process of scanning:
-	The staff is divided in groups of 2. Each group is given a scanner. There are 6 scanners.
-	The pharmacy floor is divided by zones.
-	The sales manager has a map of the zones. Most of the staff does not now the location of each zone and are searching for their zone for a couple of minutes.
-	After scanning a group brings the scanners to the sales manage. The manager uploads the data into the Omega. The process takes at least 5 minutes. Meanwhile, the group that brought the scanner is waiting until the scanner upload the information. Then they are given the next zone. 

Plan for Lean Six Sigma project.
The project will follow DMAIC framework with operational excellence and Lean procedures. 
Legend.
The pharmacy management has noticed dips in revenue in certain days and decided to launch DMAIC project to find the reasons.
During define phase I will confirm the dip in the revenue in certain days.
Deliverables:
-	I will perform every stage of the DMAIC process with all deliverables.
-	I will use Minitab and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn) for statistical tests (Pareto, t-test, hypothesis testing and so on)
-	I will create spaghetti diagram.
-	Value stream map.
-	Swimlane diagram.
After conduction the project I should conclude that the (X) was a poorly organized stock take process. Also, I will suggest some other improvements to improve the value flow.

Analyse
•	Identify Key Factors (Xs): Determine which factors (Xs) impact the problem (Y) using statistical tools.
Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram: Categorize potential root causes under categories such as:
o	People (e.g., skill level, training)
o	Process (e.g., complexity, manual steps)
o	Technology (e.g., ERP accuracy, scanner functionality)
o	Environment (e.g., storage space layout)
o	Measurement (e.g., inaccurate counts, scanner accuracy)
5 Whys Analysis: Use this tool for deep-diving into key problem statements.
Example:
Problem: "Inventory counts frequently inaccurate."
o	Why? "Products scanned multiple times causing duplicates."
o	Why? "Barcode scanner uploads are slow, teams rush and double-scan."
o	Why? "Scanner uploading system inefficient."
o	Why? "ERP synchronization slow due to connectivity issues."
o	Why? "Wi-Fi infrastructure inadequate on pharmacy floor." (Root cause)


•	Hypothesis Testing: Learn how to conduct hypothesis tests to prove or disprove the key Xs.
•	Statistical Analysis: Use tools like confidence intervals, normality tests, and regression analysis to analyze data and establish the Y=f(x) equation.
•	List of Potential Xs: Generate and organize a list of potential factors (Xs) that impact the problem (Y).
•	Shortlist of Key Xs: Compile a shortlist of likely key factors (Xs) based on initial analysis.
•	Data Collection Plan: Develop a plan for collecting data needed for further analysis.
•	Validated Key Xs: Use statistical tools to prove or disprove the key factors (Xs) that impact the problem (Y).
•	Graphical Data Analysis
Use graphs and visuals for insights and easy communication.
Pareto Chart:
o	Clearly visualize the primary reasons behind inefficiencies.
Example Pareto findings:
o	70% of inefficiencies result from manual recounting and scanner data delays.
o	20% from delays in ERP system synchronization.
o	10% from unclear zone mapping during stock-take.
Scatter Plots:
o	Visually demonstrate correlation between two variables.
o	Example: Scatter plot showing clear correlation between recounts and inventory inaccuracies.
Boxplots:
o	Illustrate variations clearly.
o	Example: Boxplot comparison of daily revenue on stock-taking vs non-stock-taking days to visualize dips.

Tests: Sample size, confidence interval, normality, compare variance, T-test, ANOVA test, contingency table, nonparametric tests. Correlation, linear regression/multiple regression 
•	Validate Root Causes
Use your data and statistical tests to validate which of your identified causes significantly impact your issue (Y).
o	Confirm your prioritized list of root causes.
Validated Root Causes Example:
o	Inefficient manual counting process due to inadequate scanning technology.
o	Frequent ERP synchronization issues.
o	Poor warehouse/shop layout leading to unnecessary movements and delays.
o	Lack of staff training in proper counting/scanning procedures.
•	Prioritize Root Causes
Prioritize root causes based on statistical significance and impact on revenue/efficiency.
Use a structured approach:
o	Cause and Effect Matrix (scores causes by impact and frequency).
o	Prioritization Matrix (importance vs. ease of implementation).
Improve
•	Generate Potential Solutions: Develop solutions to address the key factors (Xs) affecting the problem (Y).
•	Evaluate Solution Alternatives: Assess different solution options to find the most effective ones.
•	Select the Right Solutions: Choose the best set of solutions to optimize the performance of Y.
•	Pilot and Implement: Test the solutions on a small scale (pilot) and then fully implement them.
Possible tests: Two-level fractional experiments, full fractional experiments, DOE, response surface methods.
Generate Potential Solutions (Brainstorming)
Begin by creating a comprehensive list of potential solutions for your prioritized root causes.
Tools to use:
•	Brainstorming sessions with the project team and key stakeholders
•	Benchmarking industry best practices or other pharmacies
Example Potential Solutions:
•	Upgrade barcode scanners and introduce wireless handheld devices.
•	Improve Wi-Fi infrastructure in the shop to enhance ERP synchronization.
•	Redesign the warehouse/shop layout for optimized goods flow.
•	Conduct structured training for staff in inventory counting and ERP usage.
•	Schedule stock-taking processes during off-peak times to reduce disruption.

Evaluate & Select Solutions (Prioritization Matrix)
Evaluate each potential solution based on defined criteria like cost, ease of implementation, potential impact, and required resources.
Use:
•	Solutions Selection Matrix (Prioritization Matrix)
•	Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)

Pilot Testing of Chosen Solutions
Before a full-scale implementation, test chosen solutions on a smaller scale to validate their effectiveness and make adjustments.
Pilot Test Example for Barcode Scanner Upgrade:
•	Conduct a pilot with upgraded barcode scanners for one month.
•	Measure inventory accuracy, recount frequency, time taken for stock-taking.
•	Collect feedback from warehouse/sales team.
Pilot Test Example for Wi-Fi Improvement:
•	Install upgraded Wi-Fi in the shop’s critical stock-taking areas.
•	Measure ERP data synchronization speed and reliability during stock-taking.
Why Pilot Testing?
•	Reduces risks by revealing practical issues or refinements required.
•	Provides evidence of effectiveness before full-scale investment.
Develop Implementation Plan
After successful pilots and risk analysis, clearly define your full-scale implementation plan.
Implementation Plan (Example):
•	What: Deploy upgraded barcode scanners
•	Who: Warehouse team, Operations manager, IT support
•	How: Purchase and configure scanners, integrate with ERP, conduct training
•	When: Start March 1, complete by March 15
•	Resources Needed: New scanners, IT support, training sessions
•	Expected Results: Improve stock-taking accuracy by 80%, reduce recount frequency by 70%
Similar detailed plan for each selected solution: Wi-Fi, Training, Layout Redesign.
Create Improved (Future State) Process Map (Value Stream Map)
Visualize your improved process clearly, highlighting efficiencies gained and waste eliminated.
Example (Future State VSM):
•	Reduced inventory counting steps from 8 to 4.
•	ERP synchronization delay reduced from 5 minutes to <1 minute.
•	Unnecessary movements reduced significantly.
Solution Implementation & Validation
Implement fully according to your plan. Afterward, measure and confirm effectiveness.
Validation Example Results:
•	Inventory accuracy improved from 85% to 97%.
•	Revenue dips reduced by 75% on stock-taking days.
•	Overall stock-taking duration reduced by 2 hours.
Use:
•	Before-and-after Run charts
•	Control Charts
•	Customer/Employee Feedback Surveys
Control
•	Establish Controls: Implement controls to monitor key factors (Xs) and ensure sustained improved performance.
•	Develop a Control Plan: Create a plan for monitoring, controlling, and regulating performance, designed for process owners and operators.
•	Update Procedures and Train: Work with process owners to update procedures and develop communication and training plans.
•	Implement SPC Charts: Use Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts to support the control plan.
•	Validate Financial Impact: Have the finance team validate the actual financial impact of the improvements.
•	Project Completion: Sign off on project completion with the project champion and celebrate the success.
Charts: SPC chart selection/analysis, display improvements.
Develop a Control Plan
A control plan clearly defines how improved processes will be monitored and maintained. This includes specifying performance metrics, acceptable thresholds, monitoring frequency, responsibilities, and corrective actions.
Create Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
Clearly document updated processes, including:
•	Inventory counting procedures
•	Barcode scanner operation and troubleshooting
•	ERP integration and use
•	Stock-taking schedule and responsibilities
•	Staff roles clearly defined
Example SOP Contents for Inventory Counting:
•	Step-by-step counting instructions.
•	Barcode scanning guidelines.
•	ERP data entry rules.
•	How to manage and report discrepancies.
•	Contact details for support (IT, Operations Manager).
Implement Process Monitoring (Control Charts & Statistical Tools)
Regular monitoring of the improved processes is essential.
Tools to use:
•	Control Charts (X-bar and R, Individuals & Moving Range charts): 
o	Monitor ongoing process stability and detect deviations early.
Example Control Chart Monitoring:
•	Weekly Inventory Accuracy Chart (tracking deviation from 97% accuracy target).
•	Stock-taking duration monitored quarterly (tracking time reductions).
Interpretation:
•	Any data point outside control limits triggers immediate corrective action and root cause analysis.
Implement Visual Management
Visual management helps everyone see quickly whether the process is within control or if there are problems requiring attention.
Tools to use at SimplePharma:
•	Visual Dashboards: Display daily or weekly process metrics in shop/warehouse areas (accuracy %, last count results).
•	Andon boards (if applicable): Highlight any real-time issues (ERP connectivity status, inventory counting progress).
Conduct Training and Knowledge Transfer
Conduct comprehensive training sessions for all employees involved in the process.
Training Example for SimplePharma:
•	Training modules: barcode scanner use, ERP integration, counting methods, new stock-taking schedule.
•	Method: workshops, hands-on sessions, video tutorials.
•	Frequency: initial rollout training, refresher training every 6 months, training for new employees as needed.
Training Validation:
•	Evaluate effectiveness through quizzes, observations, or certifications.
